ðŸš€ Project Idea: Library Management System (API-based)
Why this project?

Covers CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Uses Entity Framework Core for database operations.

Implements relationships (One-to-Many: Books â†” Authors, Many-to-Many: Books â†” Categories).

Teaches you data validation, exception handling, and migrations.

Youâ€™ll learn how to expose REST APIs, which is super valuable for backend jobs.

Looks professional on a resume.

Features

Manage Books

Add new books (title, description, author, published year, price, etc.)

Update/Delete books

Get all books or a book by ID

Manage Authors

Each author can have multiple books (One-to-Many).

Manage Categories

A book can belong to multiple categories (Many-to-Many).

Search & Filter

Search books by title, filter by category, etc.

Bonus (if you want to go deeper):

Implement authentication (JWT).

Add Swagger for API testing.

Write unit tests using xUnit.
